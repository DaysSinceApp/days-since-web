    <div class="description">
      <div>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Days Since®</strong> (the “App”), developed and offered by <strong>A Couple of Friends OOD</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the App. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>1. Eligibility and Use of the App</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The App is intended to help users track the time that has elapsed since they last performed a
chosen activity, task, or event.</li>
            <li>You must be <strong>at least 17 years old</strong> and may use the App only for lawful purposes and in
accordance with these Terms.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2. Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Your use of the App is also subject to our <a href="https://dayssinceapp.com/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect, use, and protect information. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>3. Subscriptions and In‑App Purchases</h3>
        <h4>3.1 Subscription Plans</h4>
        <p>We offer optional subscription plans—including, but not limited to, monthly and yearly options—and a one‑time lifetime purchase that grants permanent access to premium features. Subscription options and pricing may vary by region and are displayed within the App.</p>
        <h4>3.2 Payment Processing</h4>
        <p>All purchases are handled through the Apple App Store and are subject to Apple’s terms and policies. <strong>We do not process or store any payment information.</strong></p>
        <h4>3.3 Auto‑Renewal</h4>
        <p>Subscriptions are billed in advance and renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle unless canceled. Renewal charges apply at the current rate shown in the App Store.</p>
        <h4>3.4 Free Trials</h4>
        <p>From time to time we may offer a free trial. Billing information may be required to start a trial, but you will not be charged until the trial ends. <strong>If not canceled before the trial period ends, the subscription will automatically begin and the applicable fee will be charged.</strong> We reserve the right to modify or discontinue free‑trial offers at any time.</p>
        <h4>3.5 Managing Subscriptions</h4>
        <p>You may cancel or manage your subscription in your Apple App Store account settings. Cancellation stops future charges but does not refund the current period; premium features remain available until that period ends.</p>
        <h4>3.6 Refunds and Apple Review</h4>
        <p>Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple. If you request a refund, we may share limited, non‑personal usage data (via RevenueCat) with Apple to assist in evaluating whether the subscription was meaningfully used. This data does not contain personally identifiable information.</p>
        <h4>3.7 Price Changes</h4>
        <p>We may change subscription prices at any time. For existing subscribers, Apple may require you to accept any price increase; if you do not accept, your subscription may lapse. Apple provides notice of price changes via email, push notification, or App Store alert.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>4. User Data and Third‑Party Services</h3>

We use third‑party services (e.g., Sentry, Countly, RevenueCat) for crash reporting, analytics, and purchase management; these services may collect anonymized data as described in our <a href="https://dayssinceapp.com/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
