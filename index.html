        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We take your privacy very seriously. Days Since app does not collect any personal data. All counters’ information that you input into the Days Since app remains privately stored on your device.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Crash reporting & Analytics</h3>
        <p>Days Since app uses a self-hosted instance of a crash reporting and analytics tool called Countly. Countly is open-source and you can find it's source code <a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-ios" target="_blank">here</a>. This helps us to identify crashes and stability issues and why they're caused (e.g., an edge case on iPhone SE), which greatly speeds up and eases the ability to fix them. Countly’s analytics capabilities are used within the app to better understand which features are being used - e.g., how many counters users have on average, how many users use Dark Mode, etc. This allows us to better make development decisions and choose where to focus development effort. The information collected is anonymous.</p>
        <p>Days Since app does not share, sell or rent your data, and the anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better. If you don't agree with this data collection, there's an option in the <i>Settings</i> tab called <i>Crash Reporting & Analytics</i> to completely turn it off.</p>
